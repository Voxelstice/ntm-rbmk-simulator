# NTM RBMK Simulator
A RBMK simulator, using the mechanics that are used in the minecraft mod [HBM's Nuclear Tech Mod](https://github.com/HbmMods/Hbm-s-Nuclear-Tech-GIT).

Majority of the simulation code is directly from the mod itself. All sprites with the exception of some are also directly from the mod itself.
Everything else is made by myself.

This is a reactor simulation of a NTM reactor. [Also check out ZIRNOX simulator (which is still pure JavaScript unlike this one)](https://voxelstice.github.io/ntm-zirnox-simulator/)
