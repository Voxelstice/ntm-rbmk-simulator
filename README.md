# NTM RBMK Simulator
A RBMK simulator, using the mechanics that are used in the minecraft mod [HBM's Nuclear Tech Mod](https://github.com/HbmMods/Hbm-s-Nuclear-Tech-GIT).

Every single bit of code handling the simulation and the sprites are from the minecraft mod's source code. (it's open source!!!).
Everything else is made by myself.

This is a reactor simulation of a NTM reactor. [Also check out ZIRNOX simulator](https://voxelstice.github.io/ntm-zirnox-simulator/)

# GO PLAY NTM IT'S A GOOD MOD
